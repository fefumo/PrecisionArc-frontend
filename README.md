# PrecisionArc frontend

## Key features
- [x] Written in React
- [x] Using PrimeFaces for better UI/UX
- [x] Using Redux to control the state of the token in the program. I also tried to use it to make some kind of "api" to provide hooks for sending requests from other compontents.
- [x] Has two page components - Welcome Page and Main page. Welcome Page has the login form as well as the register form. 
- [x] Thanks to PrimeReact, "weakness" of the password is automatically calculated and shown while typing, as well as an offer from the browser to save your login + password when registering ( tested only in firefox though )
- [ ] CSS not implemented. Maybe sometime later ( however, the chances of this are low ) I will try to use Tailwind
